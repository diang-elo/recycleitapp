# flutter_app

A new Flutter application.

Inspiration
Our one goal is to change how Americans and the world see recycling. We want to show them the results of what recycling can do and why repurposed things are just as good as brand new items. Not only are you saving money for yourself, you're saving the earth and keeping it well run for the next generation.

What it does
Incentivizing Recycling. At this point itâ€™s hard to be sure that items put in the recycling bin are recycled. Thats why we want to reward you for making a change. For each Item you donate you will be awarded with vouchers. WE ALSO BUY USED TECH AS WELL!

How we built it
For the Website we used HTML and CSS, and Bootstrap Library. For the Mobile app we used Flutter in order to possibly have it run smoothly on both google and apple platforms. We also added a barcode monster api, ebay price api, and google maps api for functionality.

Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges that we ran into was trying to figure out how APIs work and how to implement them into our idea app. Learning flutter was also a challenge.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
definitely our mobile app it was something new we tried for this hackathon and are excited to implement them into our own personal projects in the future

What we learned
We learned even with a limited amount of time that we could still bring an amazing idea to life and be proud of it everyone did their part and had fun which was the best part

What's next for Recycleit
Trying to bring our idea into reality this project is something that is important to us even outside of the hackathon, we know that government has done little to nothing to enforce recycling and the reproduction of recycled goods so we want to be the change!
